It is always more difficult to retain rather than to obtain customers, as it places greater responsibility towards the business. Customer retention has become a crucial part of businesses as acquiring new customers is often more costly than keeping the current ones, which has led to the need to dedicate great amount of attention to churn prediction. Businesses have come to a point where they must take into significant consideration clients’ personal characteristics and dynamic behavioral patterns of their financial transactions. Therefore, this project tends to use the clients’ demographic-based features and choice behavioral traits using individual transaction records regarding their credit cards. More generally, the proposed features can also be applied to churn prediction in other domains where demographic and behavioral data are available.</p>

<p>The time of Big Data is now! The availability of large-scale behavioral data has given the opportunity to businesses to conduct high-quality analysis of the clients’ behavior and make conclusions and predictions. It is crucial to understand that successful strategies lie on small and seemingly unimportant information. In addition, minimal information on when and where can have gigantic contribution to successful prediction and, consequently, to business success.<p>

<p>Churn prediction is a sphere of a great interest for the banking sector, as it is handling big data, as well. The purpose of this project is to build a model for churn prediction for an existing bank based on its own client database that includes demographic and transaction behavioral features. The dataset consists of the bank’s existing card owners and 19 features for each of them. Analyzing these features should lead us to creating a model that will successfully predict whether the card owner with his unique combination of demographic and financial characteristics is going to remain a bank’s client or he is going to leave.<p>

<p>Without further ado, we present the project “Banking churn prediction for marketing purposes”.<p>

<p>The project is done in few phases:

- [Data Preprocessing](#data-preprocessing)
- [Features Analysis and Visualization](#features-analysis-and-visualization)
- [Models implementation](#models-implementation)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Features Analysis and Visualization
 <p>
 <p>Utilizing Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas, we next analyzed the data. We can see that our dataset was imbalanced.</p><br/>

 <p>The graph above shows normal distribution for the age variable where most of the customers are between 40 and 55 years old. </p><br/>
